python-template-log-options

Just a quick script that's already got logging and input parameter options set up. 

Start coding in main() and you're good to go.

Log debug messages with:

	logging.debug("Oops, something went wrong")

See the "parser.add_option('-s','--samplefileoption...." section for an example of how to 
add new input parameter options. 

I'll be updating and maintaining this over time for my own purposes. Comments are welcome.
